#in tkinter theres another way to write programms which i don't really encourage to use.
import tkinter as tk
#now we see how it is different from the from tkinter import *

#personnaly it is quite messy to import as tk.
window = tk.Tk()
        #/\ tk.

#before any object on the window, you always have to write tk. at the start

tk.Label(window, text="tk. is at the start").grid()
#/\ its easier without
#and also less messy

#so we return to the better version

from tkinter import *

#this is how to properly write objects
Newlabel = Label(window, text="nothing is behind")
Newlabel.grid()

#now for buttons with options inside the command you need to use lambda.
#lambda is a simple bugfix that in some situations will solve issues.

Number = 10

def clicked(objects):
    Label(window, text=objects).grid()


clickMe = Button(window, text="click me",
                 command=lambda Number = Number: clicked(Number)) #important lambda function
clickMe.grid()          #/\                   /\ this whole part belongs to lambda
#                        lambda Number = Number: it is needed to define that changing parameter
#                                                into a changing constant.
