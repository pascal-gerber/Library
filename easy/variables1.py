#string variable
string = "2"

#the string is a text variable, meaning the calculation is only possible in text
print(string * 2, "this is a string")
#multiply the string by 2, you get twice the string, it wont add up the calculating way

#integer variable
integer = 2

#the integer variable is purely here to calculate NON COMA numbers
print(integer * 2, "this is an integer")
#calculating string and number will cause issues except if multiplied since it works!

#float variable
floats = 2.5

#the float variable contains usually comma numbers, it has very similar functions to the int
print(floats * 3, "this is a float")
#in some cases, floats cannot be used like in loops.

#boolean variable
boolTrue = True
boolFalse = False

#booleans can only contain True or False "also none" booleans are just statements.
print(boolTrue, boolFalse, "these are booleans")

#you can check the type of the variable by using the command "type"
print(type(string), "you can change the string to some different variable")

#there are a couple more variable types but for now, these are the ones you will be using the most
