#but the true can be archieved differently

#python is gonna print out true

#false works the same

#now lets put it all into a if statement
if 1 < 2:

#now we sometimes got momments where we want it to do something but if it
#doesnt work, to do something else

#the else command never needs any indication and only works after an if
#the else will activate if the if command isnt.

#now we also got momments where we wanna check if something is another way.
#basicly another if in the sentance

#is works like ==, its a python word
#IMPORTANT NOTE: it isn't the same with ==
#will be explained later

#we can also use other words like "and" and "or"

#of course theres another way you can write the and as well to make things shorter

#funny code you can make
