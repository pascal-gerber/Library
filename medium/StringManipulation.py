#for manipulating strings you have some small and simple traits.
#for the first one we can skip line with \n in the middle of a string

#in python there are other string manipulations types
#like putting betwem every letter or list object
#a certain letter/character in.

          #/\ this can also be a variable

#of course it works for lists too, but it transforms
#the list into a string
