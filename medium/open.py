#to open a file you need to use a methode called (open())
#open takes 2 options.
#first the file name and also the mode to open it.

#####################################################################
#In the File edit options there are :

#"w" = Write - will overwrite anything with the new content

#"r" = Read - will read the file if variable has .read()

#"a" = Append - will add new content as addition

#"wb" = Write binary - will write content into other types
       #of files like .exe and other in binary

#"ab" = Append binary - will append the content into
       #files as binary

#"rb" = Read binary - will read the special files binary
       #always used before anything binary

#"w+" = Write + Read - Overwrites the file but is also able
       #to read it.

#"r+" = Read + Write - Will append to the beginning new content
       #and can read the file

#"a+" = Append + Read - Will append text and read.

#"wb+" = Write binary + read binary \

#"rb+" = Read binary + write binary /

#"ab+" = Append binary + read binary
